## This is code is not mine
## After spending 3 hours to solve this problem, I have decided to look at the solution.

class Solution(object):
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        res = ''
        resLen = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            l, r = i, i
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                if (r - l + 1) > resLen:
                    res = s[l:r + 1]
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

            l, r = i, i + 1
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                if (r - l + 1) > resLen:
                    res = s[l:r + 1]
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1
        return res
